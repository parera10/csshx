"""WaveTerm launcher — opens and tiles blocks via the ``wsh`` CLI.

The ``wsh`` subcommand grammar has churned across WaveTerm releases —
``setlayout`` was renamed, ``tile`` came and went, etc. :meth:`tile`
tries the known incantations in order and caches the first one that
exits 0 for the rest of the run, so we don't pay the cost of probing
(or risk the user seeing stderr from a stale grammar) on every tile.
