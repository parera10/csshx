"""Kitty launcher — uses ``kitty @`` remote control.

Requires ``allow_remote_control yes`` in ``kitty.conf`` (or the
equivalent ``--listen-on`` flag). The constructor surfaces a clear
error if the kitty CLI isn't on PATH; runtime failures from
``kitty @ launch`` are reported with kitty's own stderr included so
config issues are easy to diagnose.

v1.0 used ``--type=window``, which opened a fresh OS window per host.
With ten ssh targets that meant ten OS-level windows — useless. v1.1
defaults to ``--type=tab`` so all blocks live as tabs of the user's
current kitty OS window, exactly like every other launcher.
``--keep-focus`` keeps the master TUI focused so the user can keep
typing without juggling windows.
